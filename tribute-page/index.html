            <h3>A brief history of the important events in Tesla's life</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1856</strong> - Nikola Tesla was born in a village Smiljan (present-day Croatia) in a
                    Serbian family.</li>
                <li><strong>1870</strong> - Tesla moved north to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real
                    Gymnasium. Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his
                    physics professor.</li>
                <li><strong>1875</strong> - He then studied electrical engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in
                    Graz, but he never graduated from the university.</li>
                <li><strong>1882</strong> - Tesla moved to Paris and started working for Continental Edison. There he
                    gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering.</li>
                <li><strong>1884</strong> - He emigrated to the United States, and he began working almost immediately
                    at the Thomas Edison's company Machine Works in New York. He quit after six months because of
                    disagreements.</li>
                <li><strong>1886</strong> - The Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing company was formed in New Jersey.
                    Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents. Check out the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nikola_Tesla_patents" alt="List of patents">list of
                        Tesla's patents</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>1887</strong> - He developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a
                    power</strong> system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of
                    its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>1888</strong> - Tesla held a lecture about the advantages of alternating current at the
                    American Institute of Electrical Engineers. </li>
                <li><strong>1891</strong> - He patented his Tesla coil, a type of resonant transformer circuit, which is
                    widely used today in radio and television sets and other electronic equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>1893</strong> - Westinghouse used Tesla’s alternating current system to light the World’s
                    Columbian Exposition at Chicago. This success was a factor in their winning the contract to install
                    the first power machinery at Niagara Falls.</li>
                <li><strong>1894</strong> - In his own laboratory he experimented with shadowgraphs similar to those
                    that later were to be used by Wilhelm Röntgen when he discovered X-rays in 1895.</li>
                <li><strong>1895</strong> - A fire breaks </strong>out in his laboratory. The fire not only set back
                    Tesla's ongoing projects, it destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models,
                    and demonstration pieces.</li>
                <li><strong>1897</strong> - He patents a series of inventions that are the foundation for modern
                    radio technology.</li>
                <li><strong>1898</strong> - Tesla demonstrates his remote control boat and patents his device for remote
                    control.</li>
                <li><strong>1899</strong> - He moved and set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado
                    Springs. At his lab, Tesla proved that the earth was a conductor, and he produced artificial
                    lightning with discharges consisting of millions of volts, and up to 135 feet (ca. 41m) long. </li>
                <li><strong>1900</strong> -Tesla began construction of Wardenclyffe Tower, a wireless world broadcasting
                    tower on Long Island. The project was abandoned because of a financial struggles. In December 1901,
                    Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, defeating Tesla in the
                    race to be first to complete such a transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>1906</strong> - He worked on his bladeless turbine. Because of a lack of funds, his ideas
                    was never made into a practical device.</li>
                <li><strong>1943</strong> - Tesla died of heart failure at the age of 86 in the New York. All of his
                    property inherited Tesla's nephew and everything was later moved in Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade.
