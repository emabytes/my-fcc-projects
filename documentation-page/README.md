# Technical Documentation Page


I made this responsive product landing page using HTML, CSS and jQuery.

The assignment 'Build a Technical Documentation Page' is a part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum (Responsive Web Design module). The goal was to build a responsive documentation page using HTML, CSS, and by following 15 user stories.

To make it responsive I used media queries and flexbox. For the mobile view navigation bar, I implemented the jQuery slideToggle method.
